# Ping

A cross-platform and blazingly fast [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) client focused on group and gaming chat.

**Status:** Very much a work in progress.

## Goals

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a fantastic chat application for communities and people who play games together. [Element](https://element.io/) is an awesome open source, E2E encrypted, and decentralized Matrix client. I would like to take aspects of both of these, mix in a native look-and-feel, fast start times, low memory usage, and create a great client for groups and gaming chat with easy audio/video calls.

In addition to those functional feats, I'd like to build Ping in a way that makes it relatively easy to support multiple platforms with shared code. This may be a fools errand, but it sounds like an interesting challenge! In doing so, I expect some boundaries will be pushed resulting in fixes and features upstreamed, helping the community overall.

## Development Getting Started

### Installing

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and optionally [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation.html) and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) for running the test Synapse server.

### Compiling

To build:

```bash
cargo build
```

To format and lint:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

### Running

To start the test Synpase server, use Docker Compose or Podman Compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f containers/dev.docker-compose.yml up

podman-compose -f containers/dev.docker-compose.yml up
```

To stop the test Synpase server, use Docker Compose or Podman Compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f containers/dev.docker-compose.yml down

podman-compose -f containers/dev.docker-compose.yml down
```
